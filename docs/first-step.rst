Okay, time to run some code! Now we will check tools we need, create project
with one executable, will build it and run. Try to follow instructions
**accurately**. The goal of this section is to run simplest configuration with
commonly/widely used tools. After you've checked that everything fine and
feel comfortable you can find more options in:
:doc:`platforms`, :doc:`generators` and :doc:`compilers`.
Each command's usage/pitfalls will be described in depth further in :ref:`Tutorials <Tutorials>`.
