macro
=====

Unlike ``function`` command the ``macro`` command doesn't create scope so it
do :ref:`modify variables <same scope>` from scope where it called.

.. note::

  * Use :ref:`function <cmake functions>` instead

.. admonition:: CMake documentation

  * `macro <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/macro.html>`__
