  A component of software configuration management, version control, also known
  as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to
  documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of
  information

Example of such software:

* :ref:`Git <Git>`
* `Subversion (SVN) <http://subversion.apache.org/>`_
* `Mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>`_
* `Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_
