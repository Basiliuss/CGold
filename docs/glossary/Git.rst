.. _Git:

As a man page states Git is the stupid content tracker originally started by
`Linus Torvalds <https://github.com/torvalds>`_.  At the time of the
writing this, Git used to manage current documents and most of the projects
related to CGold. In all cases when :ref:`VCS <VCS>` funtionality mentioned
to show the practical example Git is used but similar cases can be applied to
other :ref:`VCS's <VCS>` as well.
