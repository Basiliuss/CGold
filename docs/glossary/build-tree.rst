Build tree
----------

This is directory where :ref:`CMake <CMake>` will store generated files and
where :ref:`native build tool <native build tool>` will store it's temporary
files. Directory will contain variables/paths which are specific to your
envoronment so they doesn't mean to be shareable. E.g. you **should never**
store files from this directory to :ref:`VCS <VCS>`. Keeping build tree
in a separate directory from :ref:`source tree <source tree>` is a good practice
and called :ref:`out-of-source build <out-of-source>`.

Directory can be specified by :ref:`-B <-B>` option from command line or
by ``Browse Build...`` in CMake-GUI.
