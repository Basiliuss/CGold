Hunter
------

.. _Hunter:

Hunter is a cross-platform package manager driven by CMake. Hunter works on
Linux, OS X, Windows, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi platforms in CMake friendly
fashion. Actually Hunter is the reason why CGold exists since to be easily
integrated into Hunter project should (but not must) be nicely and correctly
written. On practice the number of such projects is very low (very-very low).
