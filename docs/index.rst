CGold: The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the CMake
------------------------------------------

Welcome to **CGold**!

This guide will show you how to use CMake and helps you to write elegant and
correct projects. We'll start from the simple cases and add more features one
by one. This tutorial covers only part of `CMake capabilities`_ - some topics
are skipped intentionally in favor of better modern approaches. E.g. there are
no instructions for writing ``Find*.cmake`` files like `FindZLIB.cmake`_ because
it's easier to add some code to generate `ZLIBConfig.cmake`_ automatically.
There will be no hints about writing superbuild project using
`ExternalProject`_ because same can be done nicely with `Hunter package
manager`_ (actually this is the main motivation of creating CGold - there are a
lot of questions about solving different issues but no appropriate places with
examples to refer). Document designed to be a good tutorial for the very
begginers but touches some aspects which may be interested to advanced
developers too. Look at it as a skeleton/starting point for further CMake
learning.

Enjoy!
